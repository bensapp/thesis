\section{A bug or a feature?}
One of the main contributions of this thesis was technical contributions that 
allow us to include a veritable kitchen sink of features---the goal was to 
include as many feature modalities as possible in our CPS and ESM models.  
Having so many features makes it difficult to determine exactly what is 
contributing to the success of our model.  From a machine learning standpoint, 
this is an attractive aspect of our system: given training data, we can try 
everything and see what works.  From a computer vision standpoint, this is a 
disadvantage---it is difficult to gain insight into why the model is performing 
well exactly.

joints vs. limbs

more features vs. more modes

time vs accuracy vs complexity

what will it take to work?
  + more data
  + more computation
