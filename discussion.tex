\section{Model comparison}


\subsection{The case for image-dependent interactions}
- more generalization
- more modalities

\subsection{More features or more modes?}


\subsection{Joints or limbs?}

\subsection{A bug or a feature?}
One of the main contributions of this thesis was technical contributions that 
allow us to include a veritable kitchen sink of features---the goal was to 
include as many feature modalities as possible in our CPS and ESM models.  
Having so many features makes it difficult to determine exactly what is 
contributing to the success of our model.  From a machine learning standpoint, 
this is an attractive aspect of our system: given training data, we can try 
everything and see what works.  From a computer vision standpoint, this is a 
disadvantage---it is difficult to gain insight into why the model is performing 
well exactly.


\subsection{Accuracy versus efficiency versus complexity}
time vs accuracy vs complexity

\chapter{Future directions}

what will it take to work?
  + more data
  + more computation

does the right cost function exist?
