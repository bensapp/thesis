I have been more successful and satisfied with my Ph.D. career than I had dared 
to hope when I started, and it is my gut feeling that it wouldnâ€™t have been 
this way anywhere but Penn.  This has not so much to do with The City of 
Brotherly Love, the ``greene Country 
Towne''\footnote{\url{http://xroads.virginia.edu/~cap/penn/pnplan.html}}, the 
so-called American 
Paris\footnote{\url{http://www.biblio.com/books/461708679.html}}, with its grit 
and soul, its food trucks, diners, brunch places and BYOBs, its parks and 
squares flush with dogs and children, its brick and colorful row houses, its 
Chinatown and Italian Market,  its sweeping Parkway with the surreally-lit City 
Hall at one end, and at the other, the steps where Rocky stood triumphant 
overlooking the city, giving a sense of belonging and ownership, and which 
quietly give way to the Schuylkill River Trail behind, allowing one to slip 
away to the solitude of Fairmount Park and, on the best of days, to the wild 
Wissahickon.  No, Philadelphia has made a lasting impression on me, but its not 
what made me whole.  Rather, it is the revolving cast of characters around me 
these last five years that have made all the difference.


I'd like to thanks Kostas Daniilidis for convincing me to come to Penn with his 
warm hospitality while introducing me to the GRASP lab.  I have continued to 
enjoy his hospitality as a student and as a visitor to Greece, and in addition 
have appreciated his skillful diplomacy throughout my career including being 
the chair of my thesis committee.  I'd also like to thank Jianbo Shi for 
further persuading me to come to Penn, and more importantly for lighting the 
computer vision fire inside of me; something I will keep for the rest of my 
life.
