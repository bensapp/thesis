\chapter{Qualitative results}\label{sec:qual-res}

Here we include the output of our various systems on the datasets Buffy, Pascal 
and VideoPose datasets discussed in \secref{experiments}.

\section{CPS results}
\begin{itemize}
\item CPS results on Buffy \figref{buffy-cps1}
\item CPS results on Buffy \figref{buffy-cps2}
\item CPS results on Buffy \figref{buffy-cps3}
\item CPS results on Buffy \figref{buffy-cps4}

\item CPS results on Pascal \figref{pascal-cps1}
\item CPS results on Pascal \figref{pascal-cps2}
\item CPS results on Pascal \figref{pascal-cps3}
\item CPS results on Pascal \figref{pascal-cps4}
\item CPS results on Pascal \figref{pascal-cps5}
\end{itemize}

\section{ESM results}

Video pose estimation is best viewed in video:

\item \citet{eichner09} on VideoPose: \\

\end{itemize}

\section{LLPS results}

A sampling of results of LLPS are shown in \figref{llps1}, \figref{llps2} and 
\figref{llps3}. The $32$ modes are displayed as average image cluster center 
thumbnails.  Red 'X's denote modes filtered by the cascade step in less than 
$0.02$ seconds.  The remaining models are run, and the final predicted mode is 
highlighted with the green rectangle.  The predicted pose is overlaid as limbs 
for the upper and lower arm on the test image.
