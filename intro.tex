``Geman quote''

why i love what i do:
One of the most compelling problems of computer vision is general object 
recognition.  The ability for computers or robots to do this is blah

why pose?
it's super hard: Human pose estimation inherits all the difficulties of object 
recognition
it shows off computation

philosopical question - humans can do it, babies,  dogs can do it - why can't a 
computer
